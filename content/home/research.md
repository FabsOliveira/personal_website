## Current research topics

### Energy systems optimisation

### Inventory control using stochastic programming

[![blood_inventory](https://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7270186/data/australia-red-cross-processing-facility-5-data.jpg)](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-23/australian-red-cross-what-happens-to-blood-after-donation/7267878)

Combining traditional inventory control theory with the flexibility of stochastic programming we are able to address more general settings. Some ideas we have been exploring:

* Modelling of different control policies
* Development of decomposition methods
* Real-world application: blood/ platelets inventory management


### Emergency Response, Humanitarian Logistics and Healthcare Planning

Investigating how we can use operations research to ultimately save lives. Challenges include:

* Pre-location of emergency response supplies
* Distribution of bednets to fight Malaria
* Drug inventory routing
