## Current research topics

### Energy systems optimisation

Applications of optimisation under uncertainty techniques to represent the evolution of energy systems and devise policy and decision making support to foster the adoption of low-carbon energy production. Some problems include:

* Infrastucture expansion planning under uncertainty
* Scenario generation and uncertainty representation
* Efficient methods for market equilibrium problem 

### Inventory control using stochastic programming

Combining traditional inventory control theory with the flexibility of stochastic programming we are able to address more general settings. Some ideas we have been exploring:

* Modelling of alternative control policies
* Incorporating aspect such as perishability, leasd times, pooling effects, etc.
* Development of decomposition methods

### Emergency Response, Humanitarian Logistics and Healthcare Planning

Investigating how we can use operations research to ultimately save lives. Challenges include:

* Pre-location of emergency response supplies
* Distribution of bednets to fight Malaria
* Drug inventory routing
* Blood units/ platelets inventory management
