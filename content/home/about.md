# Biography

My research involves the topics of *prescriptive analytics* and **operations research**, in particular **analytics**, **optimisation**, and **mathematical programming**, applied to **supply chain management** and **production planning**.

The main focus of my research is the development of decision support frameworks based on optimisation under uncertainty that can be used for improving decision making in real-world problems.

My research interests are methodological developments and applications of mathematical programming to real-world problems in the areas of **renewable energy production**, **healthcare** and **humanitarian logistics**.
