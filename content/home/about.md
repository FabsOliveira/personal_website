# Biography

My research involves the topics of analytics and operations research, in particular predictive/ prescriptive analytics, optimisation, and mathematical programming, applied to supply chain management and production planning. Its main focus is the development of decision support frameworks based on optimisation under uncertainty that can be used for improving decision making in real-world problems. 

My research interests are applications of mathematical programming to real-world problems in the areas of *renewable energy production and infrastructure expansion planning*, *healthcare sector*, and *humanitarian logistics*.
