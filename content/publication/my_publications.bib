abstract = {Problems related to disaster management are strongly influenced by random outcomes, which indicates the importance of using a mathematical tool that can coherently take into account the stochasticity associated with humanitarian logistics problems. However, stochastic models can lead to decisions that consider solely expected values and thus neglect the eventual damage associated with the worst-case scenarios of a disaster. Two-stage stochastic optimization can lead to solutions that present relief supply shortages that could be often prevented. Bearing this in mind, models with risk aversion have been proposed to make decisions that are better suited to humanitarian operations. In this paper, we propose a model for pre-positioning, location and distribution that uses the measure of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to better attend to affected people in a disaster. A post-optimization analysis is conducted to evaluate the quality of the solution. The results indicate that a risk-aversion profile can lead to a 100{\%} reduction of shortages that can be avoided.},

We present deterministic and stochastic programming models for the workover rig problem, one of the most challenging problems in the oil industry. In the deterministic approach, an integer linear programming model is used to determine the rig fleet size and schedule needed to service wells while maximizing oil production and minimizing rig usage cost. The stochastic approach is an extension of the deterministic method and relies on a two-stage stochastic programming model to define the optimal rig fleet size considering uncertainty in the intervention time. In this approach, different scenario-generation methods are compared. Several experiments were performed using instances based on real-world problems. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can be used to solve large instances and produces quality solutions in computationally reasonable times.},

abstract = {We contribute improvements to a Lagrangian dual solution approach applied to large-scale optimization problems whose objective functions are convex, continuously differentiable and possibly nonlinear, while the non-relaxed constraint set is compact but not necessarily convex. Such problems arise, for example, in the split-variable deterministic reformulation of stochastic mixed-integer optimization problems. The dual solution approach needs to address the nonconvexity of the non-relaxed constraint set while being efficiently implementable in parallel. We adapt the augmented Lagrangian method framework to address the presence of nonconvexity in the non-relaxed constraint set and the need for efficient parallelization. The development of our approach is most naturally compared with the development of proximal bundle methods and especially with their use of serious step conditions. However, deviations from these developments allow for an improvement in efficiency with which parallelization can be utilized. Pivotal in our modification to the augmented Lagrangian method is the use of an integration of approaches based on the simplicial decomposition method (SDM) and the nonlinear block Gauss-Seidel (GS) method. An adaptation of a serious step condition associated with proximal bundle methods allows for the approximation tolerance to be automatically adjusted. Under mild conditions optimal dual convergence is proven, and we report computational results on test instances from the stochastic optimization literature. We demonstrate improvement in parallel speedup over a baseline parallel approach.},

In addition, to achieve better customer services, we introduce a variable rationing rule to address quantities of the item in short. The devised models are reformulated into their deterministic equivalent, resulting in nonlinear mixed-integer programming models, which are then approximately linearized. To deal with the uncertain nature of the item demand levels, we apply a Monte Carlo simulation-based method to generate finite and discrete sets of scenarios. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require restricted assumptions to the behavior of the probabilistic phenomena, as does several existing methods in the literature. Numerical experiments with the proposed approach for randomly generated instances of the problem show results with errors around 1{\%}.},

abstract = {The Brazilian oil industry has gained new momentum after the discovery of large oil reserves in deep under- water. Numerous investments in the oil production chain are expected to support the scale of this operation. Given this context, the use of a decision support system (DSS), which encompasses the complexity of the oil supply chain to support investment decisions, becomes crucial. This paper proposes a DSS that is based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that allows the evaluation of different investment alternatives in logistics networks, such as expanding the capacity for transport, handling, and/or storage. Additionally, the DSS is composed of a database structure, business intelligence environment, and graphical visualization tool. The features of the proposed system were evaluated in two case studies. The first case study assesses the synergies between two projects: specifically the expansion of the berthing capacity of vessels in a marine terminal, and the increase in the transport capacity of the pipeline that connects the marine terminal to a distribution base. The second case study evaluates the dependency of the investment in sections of a pipeline that connects a refinery to several distribution bases. These case studies demonstrate the potential use of a DSS that currently optimizes investments in the Brazilian petroleum supply chain.},

abstract = {Managing inventories in the blood supply chain is a challenging task, mainly due to the uncertain nature of the demand for blood units, the perishable nature of the blood, and a strong subjective bias towards criteria other than cost minimisation. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model for defining optimal periodic review policies for red blood cells inventory management that focus on minimising operational costs, as well as blood shortage and wastage due to outdating, taking into account perishability and demand uncertainty. The adoption of this framework allows the consideration of more general stochastic processes to model the demand uncertainty than approaches currently available in literature. Moreover, this framework renders a model that can be solved efficiently by general purpose off-the-shelf optimisation software. To illustrate the potential benefits of adopting the proposed model to support the definition of optimal blood inventory control policies, a case study is presented considering realistic data representing the daily demand for blood, which was generated using the average and standard deviation of the demand for eight types of blood. Results suggest meaningful insights concerning practices that could lead to improvement in the blood supply chain performance. In particular, we observed that it would be possible to revise the current inventory control policies by reducing current target levels to diminish wastage and total cost without compromising the service level. Finally, the consideration of blood substitutions showed further improvement in the performance of the blood inventory management system.},

A real-life data-set related to the production of fuel oil and asphalt in a large refinery was used. TheMILP andGAmodels proved to be good solutions for both primary objectives, but the GA model resulted in a smaller number of operational changes. The reason for this is that GA incorporates a multi-criteria approach, which is capable of adaptively updating the weights of the objective throughout the evolutionary process.},

We show how to improve significantly the decision-making process in a Brazilian petroleum company using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to represent COSP. Comparison tests with a current ship-scheduling method adopted in the company indicated that the use of the MILP model increased the transportation efficiency and reduced costs by 20{\%} on average.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Many engineering-to-order (ETO) organizations are multi-project capacity-driven production systems in which capacity planning is of major importance in the order acceptance phase. The academic literature, in this area, presents a research-practice gap with a lack of studies on the application of decision support tools to address capacity planning problems in real-world ETO settings. To reduce this gap, this paper presents the findings from an action research on the application of an optimization model to support tactical capacity planning in a medium-sized project-driven ETO organization. To properly model the studied environment, the proposed solution includes the representation of overlapping and variable intensity activities and the use of nonregular capacity options (e.g., overtime, hiring workers, subcontracting). The model was fed with real-world data and solved in order to check whether it actually reflects the planning problem. Furthermore, alternative scenarios were also generated to assist the management board in the order acceptance phase. As for practical implications, for the company manufacturing team, the modeĺs application enhanced the decision-making process regarding tactical capacity planning, addressing different shortcomings of the current planning method. Moreover, the proposed solution represents a diagnostic and decision support tool because it helps this team to identify the potential gaps between capacity and demand and also it demonstrates how to adapt capacity to demand and how to optimally balance demand. From an academic perspective, this research adds empirical evidence to enrich the existing literature, as it not only presents a real case application, but also highlights issues that either are not entirely explored in other studies or must be adapted to properly model a specific but real-world production setting.},

abstract = {The inventory control system consists of defining strategies to manage inventory replenishment such that costs involved in ordering, holding, and meeting the demands are optimized. Although several methods for inventory management are proposed in the literature, the assumptions made necessary can hinder their applicability in practice. Motivated by this fact, we propose a methodology for determining the optimal parameters of an inventory control system for single-item one-echelon supply chains using two-stage stochastic programming, considering periodic review and uncertain demand. The proposed approach is flexible enough to consider backlogs or lost sales cases without limitations on the number of outstanding orders and allows the consideration of uncertainties in a more comprehensive manner when compared to currently available methods. The optimal review periodicity and the inventory target level are determined using a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model, which takes into account the uncertain nature of the item demand levels through a finite set of scenarios. We present how this model can be reformulated as a deterministic equivalent mixed-integer linear programing model and how the Sample Average Approximation method can be used to incorporate the uncertainty into it. To validate the proposed approach, we perform a simulation-based sensitivity analysis in the neighborhood of the solutions obtained. We also compare them with those obtained applying the Hadley-Whitin method, considering the premises that are necessary for the later. Further, we present results from a case in which the stochastic demand is not stationary. The results obtained provide strong evidence of the potential of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Oil refining is one of the most complex activities in the chemical industry due to its nonlinear nature, which ruins the convexity properties and prevents any guarantees of the global optimality of solutions obtained by local nonlinear programming (NLP) algorithms. Moreover, using global optimization algorithms is often not feasible because they typically require large computational efforts. This paper proposes the use of convex relaxations based on McCormick envelopes for the Refinery Operations Planning Problem (ROPP) that can be used to generate both initial solutions for the ROPP and to estimate optimality gaps for the solutions obtained. The results obtained using data from a real-world refinery suggest that the proposed approach can provide reasonably good solutions for the ROPP, even for cases in which there was no solution available using traditional local NLP algorithms. Furthermore, compared with a global optimization solver, the proposed heuristic is capable of obtaining better solutions in less computational time.},

@article{Oliveira2012,
abstract = {This paper presents the application of a stochastic Benders decomposition algorithm for the problem of supply chain investment planning under uncertainty applied to the petroleum byproducts supply chain. The uncertainty considered is related with the unknown demand levels for oil products. For this purpose, a model was developed based on two-stage stochastic programming. It is proposed two different solution methodologies, one based on the classical cutting plane approach presented by Van Slyke {\&} Wets (1969), and other, based on a multi cut extension of it, firstly introduced by Birge {\&} Louveaux (1988). The methods were evaluated on a real sized case study. Preliminary numerical results obtained from computational experiments are encouraging.},

@article{Oliveira2012a,
abstract = {This Article addresses the problem of optimizing the investment planning process of a logistics infrastructure for the distribution of petroleum products under uncertainty. For this purpose, a two-stage stochastic model was developed. Because of the large number of possible scenarios for the future realization of demands, the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) methodology was used to produce approximations of the optimal solution. The proposed model and solution methodology were applied to a real case study on the distribution of petroleum products in northern Brazil. The results show that the methodology allows us to obtain solutions that are relatively close to the real optimal solution of the problem with optimality gaps estimated at up to 1{\%}, which are reasonable for most practical purposes. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},
