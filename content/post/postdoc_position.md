## Postdoctoral position in Energy Systems Planning

We are seeking a **Postdoctoral researcher in Optimisation under Uncertainty for Energy Systems Planning** to join our group as soon as possible. 

Our research is focused on developing models and methods for analysing energy systems and exploring potential development pathways in face of more stringent carbon emission limits and the expansion of intermittent renewable generation. In particular, we are concentrated on understanding how policy shifts, market settings, technological developments, among other aspects, can influence the transition to a more (environmentally) sustainable energy system. 

To achieve this objective, we develop and employ models based on data-driven adaptive/robust optimization, stochastic programming combined with efficient computational methods based on  decomposition and parallelization. Some of the current themes our group has been working on includes but are not limited to:

1. Modelling and assessing flexibility alternatives in the Nordics and Europe.
2. Investigating market power shifts in the presence of storage alternatives and transmission expansion.
3. Modelling welfare maximization in competitive market settings.

If you are interested, please have a look on this [link](https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-positions/postdoctoral-researcher-in-optimisation-under-uncertainty-for-energy-systems) for a list of requirements and instructions for application.
